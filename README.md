Hi! I'm Al John Rendon, recently graduated as Software Developer.
I am now in the stage where my focus is to become a Front-End Developer.
And currently learning the HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT/REACT and hoping to enhance it in the near future.
Right now I'm looking for Internships/Graduate/Junior Positions where I can practice more my knowledge.
You can me thru my email address: ocampo_allen16@yahoo.com

THANK YOU!
